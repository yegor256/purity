# Fibonacci in "Pure" Object-Oriented Languages

[![make](https://github.com/yegor256/purity/actions/workflows/make.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yegor256/purity/actions/workflows/make.yml)

Using a few pure object-oriented programming languages,
I wrote the same simple program that calculates Fibonacci
number. Just for fun.

The languages are:

* [Ruby](/ruby)
* [Smalltalk](/smalltalk)
* [Io](/io)
* [Scala](/scala)
* [Dart](/dart)

If you know any other "pure" OOP languages, submit a pull request.
